 * This implementation is shady. What we do here is to look at the output of
 * iptables -L, look for our own IP, and then remove all rules matching our IP
 * from the FORWARD chain. There are several problems with this:
 *	- We don't lock the iptable to ensure the list we're comparing against
 *	  matches the actual list were removing from
 *	- We don't know whether we actually added the rules ourselves, or if
 *	  someone else did.
 * in short.. this function should be re-implemented in some other way where we
 * have atomic transactions for lookup and remove, and where we're also certain
 * we are actually the originators of the rule in question.
