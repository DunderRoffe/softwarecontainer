 *
 * Limit the incoming and outgoing bandwidth on a network interface. The limits
 * are specified using params.tc_rate. The interface is specified using
 * params.net_iface_name.
 *
 * This function forks an observing process in order to detect the availability
 * of the network interface.
 *
 * \param params   An initialized lxc_params struct, specifically tc_rate and
 *                 net_iface_name must be set
 * \return 0       Upon success
 * \return -EINVAL Upon failure

 * \return 0       upon success
