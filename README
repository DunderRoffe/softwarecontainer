mkdir /tmp/vim_app/
cp `which vim` /tmp/vim_app/
echo "Hello world" > /tmp/vim_app/my_text_file.txt
pelagicontain /tmp/vim_app/ "/deployed_app/vim /deployed_app/my_text_file.txt"

The above command should, if all goes well, launch vim inside a container.

In order to launch programs, we need access to some standard libraries. The LXC template contains some mount bindings to standard library paths. These can be tweaked by editing the
